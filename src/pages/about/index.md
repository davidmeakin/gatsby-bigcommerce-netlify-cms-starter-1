### Creatively sourced for those that care
We've searched the world to find products that we feel will not only speak to us, but any individuals that desire a positive outlook in a sustainable way.

### We're adventurers
Check in and you'll see us focused on an exciting experience that is typically a bold, sometimes risky, undertaking. Our travels have taken us into activities ranging from skydiving to mountain climbing to scuba diving and back.

### Retail is our therapy
Taking the scenic route through a city and figuring out what resonates with us is one of our favorite activies. Curation equals relaxation for us.

### We started a while ago
Our first retail shop was up and running almost 30 years ago!
